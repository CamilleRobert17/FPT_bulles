Problème numéro 10 : Bubbles under a wet glass

In the right conditions, if a wet glass is turned upside down and put on a flat (but not necessarily polished) surface, air bubbles start appearing in the bottom part of it. Reproduce and explain the phenomenon. Which parameters define the number of bubbles (and lines, in which they aggregate) and their lifetime? Can one make a complete circle of bubbles along the inner wall of the glass?
